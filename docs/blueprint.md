# **App Name**: CareerPath Navigator

## Core Features:

- Job Listings Display: Display a scrollable list of available job posts with key details (title, company, location).
- Course Listings Display: Display available courses with a thumbnail, title, and brief description. Link to external payment/course page.
- Theme Toggle: Allow the user to toggle between light and dark themes.
- AI Job Description Summarizer: Use generative AI to generate summaries of job descriptions. This will be a tool that will assist job seekers when there is too much information available on screen at once.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5DADE2), inspired by a sense of trust and reliability for career navigation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F7FA), providing a clean and neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Soft green (#A3E4D7), used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements such as buttons or links.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font.
- Simple, clear icons from a standard library (e.g., Material Design Icons) for job categories, location, and other key information.
- Clean, card-based layouts for both job and course listings to ensure easy readability and scannability.
- Subtle fade-in effects when loading new content or transitioning between pages for a smoother user experience.
